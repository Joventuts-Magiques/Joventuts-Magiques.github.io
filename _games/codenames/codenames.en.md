## Overview

Codenames is a word and social deduction game created by Vlaada Chvátil in 2015. Two teams compete to be the first to identify all their secret agents on a board of 25 words, using only one-word clues given by their spymasters.

## Components

- **200 word cards** (double-sided)
- **40 key cards** (game patterns)
- **8 agent cards** (blue)
- **8 agent cards** (red)
- **7 innocent bystander cards**
- **1 assassin card**
- **1 card stand**
- **Sand timer** (optional)

## Objective

Be the first team to identify all your agents (8 or 9 depending on who starts) without touching the assassin.

## Setup

1. **Divide into 2 teams**: Blue and Red
2. **Each team chooses a Spymaster**
3. **Place 25 word cards** in a 5×5 grid
4. **Spymasters take a key card** and place it in the stand
5. **Place agent cards** according to the key card

## How to Play

### Spymaster's Turn

1. **Give a clue**: One word + a number
   - The word must relate to your words
   - The number indicates how many words relate
2. **Example**: "Fruit 2" to relate APPLE and BANANA

### Team's Turn

1. **Discuss** possible words
2. **Touch a word card**
3. **Spymaster reveals** the color:
   - **Your color**: Continue guessing (maximum number + 1)
   - **Opposite color**: Turn passes to other team
   - **Innocent bystander**: Turn ends
   - **Assassin**: You lose immediately!

## Strategies

### For the Spymaster

1. **Think of multiple connections**: Relate several words
2. **Avoid the assassin**: Priority number 1
3. **Consider context**: How will the team interpret
4. **Risky clues**: Only if you're sure

### For the Team

1. **Communicate**: Share your ideas
2. **Consider all options**: Before touching
3. **Remember previous clues**: May be relevant
4. **Don't rush**: Think carefully
