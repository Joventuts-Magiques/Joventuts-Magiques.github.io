## General Description

Potion Explosion is a resource selection and combo game designed by Stefano Castelli, Andrea Crespi and Lorenzo Silva, published by Horrible Guild in 2015. Players are alchemy students who must complete potions by grabbing ingredients (colored marbles) from a dispenser. The trick is that when you pick a marble and two marbles of the same color collide, an explosion occurs and you get those marbles too!

## Game Components

- **1 Dispenser** with 5 tracks
- **80 Ingredient Marbles** (4 colors, 20 of each):
  - **Unicorn Tears** (blue)
  - **Ogre Mucus** (black)
  - **Dragon Smoke** (red)
  - **Fairy Dandruff** (yellow)
- **64 Potion Tiles** (8 types, 8 of each)
- **15 Skill Tokens** (worth 4 points each)
- **21 Little Help Tokens** (penalty of -2 points)
- **Lab Boards** (1 per player)

## Game Objective

Score the most points by completing potions and earning skill tokens. The game ends when the last skill tokens are taken.

## Setup

1. **Assemble the dispenser** and place it in the center of the table
2. **Fill the dispenser** with all 80 marbles randomly
3. **Choose 6 potion types** to play with (remove 2 types from the 8 available)
4. **Separate the starter potions** (marked with ⭐ star) from the 6 chosen types
5. **Deal 2 random starter potions** to each player
6. **Shuffle the remaining starter potions** with the rest of the tiles from the 6 types and make 6 face-down stacks
7. **Reveal 2 tiles** from the top of each stack
8. **Place the skill tokens** according to the number of players:
   - 2 players: 4 tokens
   - 3 players: 5 tokens
   - 4 players: 6 tokens
9. **Each player takes a lab board**
10. The youngest player goes first

## How to Play

### Your Turn

1. **Pick a marble from the dispenser**
   - Choose any marble from one of the 5 tracks
   - The marbles above it fall down

2. **Resolve explosions**
   - If after falling, two or more marbles of the **same color** touch, they **explode**!
   - You take all the marbles from the explosion
   - The marbles above fall again and can cause **new chain explosions**
   - Continue until there are no more explosions

3. **Place the marbles**
   - Put the marbles you obtained in the corresponding holes of your potions
   - Or store up to 3 in the reserve area of your board

4. **Complete potions**
   - When all holes of a potion are filled, the potion is complete
   - Return the marbles to the dispenser
   - Flip the tile to show the points
   - Now you can use the potion's power!

5. **Take a new potion**
   - Choose a new potion from those available to replace the completed one

### Asking for Help

- You can take **1 extra marble** from the dispenser (without causing an explosion) for each Little Help token you take
- Each Little Help token is worth **-2 points** at the end of the game
- You can ask for help multiple times per turn

- Each token is worth **4 points**
- When you take the last skill token, the **end of the game** is triggered

## End of Game

The game ends when the last skill token is taken. The round is completed so everyone has the same number of turns.

### Scoring

Add up:

- **Points from completed potions**
- **+4 points** for each skill token
- **-2 points** for each Little Help token

The player with the most points wins!

### Tiebreaker

In case of a tie, the player with the most ingredients in their ongoing potions wins.

## Recommended Strategies

### Basic Strategies

- **Look for chain explosions**: Plan which marble to pick to maximize explosions
- **Manage your reserve**: Remember you can only store 3 marbles
- **Use completed potions**: Their powers are very useful!

### Advanced Strategies

- **Combine powers**: Some potions work very well together
- **Watch your rivals**: Don't leave easy explosions for others
- **Skill mastery**: Decide early if you want 3 same or 5 different
- **Minimize help**: -2 points per token can make a difference

## Tips for Beginners

1. **Look before you pick**: Study the dispenser and imagine what will happen
2. **Don't forget the powers**: Completed potions have very useful abilities
3. **Balance speed and points**: Higher-point potions take longer to complete
4. **Watch the endgame**: When few skill tokens remain, speed up!
