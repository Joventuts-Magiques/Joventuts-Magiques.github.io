## Overview

Catan is a strategic building and trading game created by Klaus Teuber in 1995. Players take on the role of settlers arriving on the island of Catan, rich in natural resources. The goal is to build settlements, cities, and roads while trading with other players to obtain necessary resources.

## Game Components

- **Modular board** with 19 terrain hexagons
- **95 resource cards** (wood, wool, wheat, brick, ore)
- **25 development cards**
- **4 sets of wooden pieces** (16 roads, 5 settlements, 4 cities per player)
- **2 six-sided dice**
- **1 robber** (black piece)
- **18 number tokens** (2-12)
- **2 special cards** (Longest Road, Largest Army)

## Game Objective

Be the first player to reach 10 victory points by building settlements, cities, roads, and obtaining development cards.

## Setup

1. **Assemble the board** by placing terrain hexagons randomly
2. **Place number tokens** on hexagons (avoid placing 6 and 8 adjacent)
3. **Place the robber** on the desert
4. **Each player chooses a color** and takes their pieces
5. **Initial placement**: Each player places 2 settlements and 2 roads in turn order
6. **Starting resources**: Each player receives resources from hexagons adjacent to their second settlement

## How to Play

### On Your Turn

1. **Roll dice**: All players receive resources from hexagons with the rolled number
2. **Trade**: You can exchange resources with other players or the bank
3. **Build**: Spend resources to build roads, settlements, or cities
4. **Buy development cards**: Optional, using wheat, wool, and ore

### Resource Production

- **Wood**: Forests (green)
- **Wool**: Pastures (light green)
- **Wheat**: Fields (yellow)
- **Brick**: Hills (brown)
- **Ore**: Mountains (gray)

### Buildings and Costs

- **Road**: 1 wood + 1 brick (1 point if longest)
- **Settlement**: 1 wood + 1 brick + 1 wheat + 1 wool (1 victory point)
- **City**: 3 ore + 2 wheat (2 victory points, replaces settlement)

### The Robber

When 7 is rolled:

- Players with more than 7 cards discard half
- Active player moves the robber to a different hexagon
- Can steal a card from a player with settlement/city adjacent to robber

### Development Cards

- **Knight**: Move the robber (3 knights = Largest Army, 2 points)
- **Victory Point**: 1 additional point (kept secret)
- **Progress**: Monopoly, Road Building, Year of Plenty

## Recommended Strategies

### Basic Strategies

- **Diversify resources**: Place settlements on different terrain types
- **Control frequent numbers**: 6 and 8 are most likely to be rolled
- **Block opponents**: Use the robber strategically
- **Trade actively**: Negotiation is key to progress

### Advanced Strategies

- **Control ports**: 2:1 ports are very valuable
- **Plan for longest road**: 2 extra victory points
- **Manage development cards**: Buy them when you have excess resources
- **Robber timing**: Use it to slow down the leader
