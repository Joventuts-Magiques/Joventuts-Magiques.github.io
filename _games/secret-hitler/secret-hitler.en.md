## Overview

Secret Hitler is a social deduction and political deception game created by Mike Boxleiter, Tommy Maranges, and Max Temkin in 2016. Set in 1930s Germany, players are divided into liberals and fascists, with one player taking on the secret role of Hitler. Liberals try to pass liberal policies and assassinate Hitler, while fascists try to pass fascist policies and bring Hitler to power.

## Game Components

- **Role Cards** (secret identities)
- **Party Membership Cards** (affiliation)
- **Policy Cards** (11 fascist, 6 liberal)
- **Government Board** (policy tracking)
- **Ballot Cards** (Ja/Nein per player)
- **President and Chancellor Placards**
- **Election Tracker**

## Game Objective

### Liberals Win If

- They pass **5 liberal policies**
- They **assassinate Hitler** after 3 fascist policies are enacted

### Fascists Win If

- They pass **6 fascist policies**
- **Hitler is elected Chancellor** after 3 fascist policies are enacted

## Setup

### Role Distribution (by player count)

**5 players**: 3 Liberals, 1 Fascist, 1 Hitler
**6 players**: 4 Liberals, 1 Fascist, 1 Hitler
**7 players**: 4 Liberals, 2 Fascists, 1 Hitler
**8 players**: 5 Liberals, 2 Fascists, 1 Hitler
**9 players**: 5 Liberals, 3 Fascists, 1 Hitler
**10 players**: 6 Liberals, 3 Fascists, 1 Hitler

### Initial Setup

1. **Deal Role cards** according to player count
2. **Everyone closes their eyes**
3. **Fascists and Hitler open their eyes** to recognize each other
   - In 5-6 player games: Hitler doesn't know who the fascists are
   - In 7-10 player games: Hitler knows who the fascists are
4. **Shuffle Policy cards** and place them face-down
5. **Choose an initial President** randomly

## How to Play

### Phase 1: Election

1. **President nominates a Chancellor**
   - Cannot be the previous President or Chancellor (except in 5-player games)
2. **Everyone votes** simultaneously (Ja or Nein)
3. **If majority votes Ja**:
   - Government is elected
   - Proceed to Legislative Phase
4. **If majority votes Nein**:
   - Government is rejected
   - Election Tracker advances
   - Presidency passes to next player
   - **If 3 consecutive governments fail**: Top policy is enacted automatically (Chaos)

### Phase 2: Legislative

1. **President draws 3 Policy cards**
2. **President discards 1 card** secretly
3. **President passes 2 cards** to Chancellor
4. **Chancellor discards 1 card** secretly
5. **Chancellor enacts 1 policy**
6. **Policy is added to the board**

### Phase 3: Executive Power

After enacting certain fascist policies, the President gains special powers:

**After 1-2 fascist policies** (depending on player count):

- **Investigate Loyalty**: Look at a player's Party Membership card

**After 3 fascist policies**:

- **Special Election**: Choose the next President (skip normal order)

**After 4-5 fascist policies**:

- **Execution**: Remove a player from the game
- **Veto Power**: President and Chancellor can veto the agenda (both must agree)

## Strategies

### For Liberals

1. **Trust but verify**: Watch for behavioral patterns
2. **Communicate openly**: Share information
3. **Identify Hitler**: Key to winning
4. **Use executive powers**: Investigate suspicious players
5. **Vote strategically**: Don't let Hitler become Chancellor late game
6. **Build alliances**: Work with trusted players

### For Fascists

1. **Protect Hitler**: Don't make him suspicious
2. **Create confusion**: Accuse liberals of being fascists
3. **Control the narrative**: Justify your actions
4. **Sacrifice yourself if needed**: To protect Hitler
5. **Time Hitler's Chancellorship**: Wait for the right moment
6. **Appear liberal**: Pass liberal policies when necessary

### For Hitler

1. **Act like a liberal**: Until it's safe to reveal yourself
2. **Let fascists do the dirty work**
3. **Build trust**: Get elected Chancellor when it matters
4. **Don't rush**: Wait until 3 fascist policies are enacted
5. **Always deny**: Even if investigated

## Tips for Beginners

1. **Start with 7-8 players**: Ideal balance
2. **Liberals: talk a lot**: Information is power
3. **Fascists: be subtle**: Don't coordinate openly
4. **Watch the votes**: They reveal a lot about loyalty
5. **Don't trust blindly**: Even liberals can seem suspicious
6. **Learn from mistakes**: Each game teaches new tactics
