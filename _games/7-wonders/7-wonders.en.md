## Overview

7 Wonders is a civilization development game created by Antoine Bauza in 2010. Players lead one of the seven great cities of the ancient world, developing their civilization through three historical ages. The game uses an innovative card drafting system that allows simultaneous play.

## Game Components

- **7 wonder boards** (Alexandria, Babylon, Ephesos, Gizah, Halikarnassos, Olympia, Rhodes)
- **149 cards** divided into three ages (I, II, III)
- **Coin tokens** of different values
- **Conflict tokens** (victory and defeat)
- **Score pad**
- **Reference cards** for each player

## Game Objective

Accumulate the maximum number of victory points by developing your civilization through building structures, scientific advances, military strength, and constructing your wonder.

## Setup

1. **Each player chooses a wonder** randomly and takes its board
2. **Distribute 3 coins** to each player
3. **Shuffle cards by age** separately
4. **Deal 7 Age I cards** to each player
5. **Place conflict tokens** in the center of the table

## How to Play

### Game Structure

The game is played over **3 ages**, each with **6 rounds** of card drafting.

### Game Round

1. **Choose a card** from your hand
2. **Decide action**: Build structure, build wonder, or sell for coins
3. **Execute action** simultaneously with all players
4. **Pass hand** to adjacent player (left in ages I & III, right in age II)
5. **Repeat** until only one card remains (which is discarded)

### Card Types

#### Brown Structures (Raw Materials)

- Produce basic resources: wood, clay, stone, ore

#### Grey Structures (Manufactured Goods)

- Produce refined goods: textile, papyrus, glass

#### Blue Structures (Civic Buildings)

- Provide direct victory points

#### Red Structures (Military Structures)

- Increase military strength for conflicts

#### Green Structures (Scientific Buildings)

- Provide scientific symbols for victory points

#### Yellow Structures (Commercial Buildings)

- Generate coins and facilitate trade

#### Purple Structures (Guilds - Age III only)

- Provide points based on neighbors' structures

### Construction

#### Build Structure

- Pay required resources (own or bought from neighbors)
- Some cards can be built for free if you have prerequisites

#### Build Wonder

- Discard a card and pay the wonder stage resources
- Each wonder has unique effects and victory points

#### Sell for Coins

- Discard the card and receive 3 coins

### Trade

- You can buy resources from your **direct neighbors** (left and right)
- Base cost: **2 coins** per resource
- Some cards reduce this cost

### Military Conflicts

At the end of each age:

- Compare your military strength with each neighbor
- **Victory**: Receive victory token (1, 3, or 5 points depending on age)
- **Defeat**: Receive defeat token (-1 point)

## Final Scoring

- **Conflict tokens**: Victories add, defeats subtract
- **Coins**: 1 point per 3 coins
- **Wonders**: Points indicated on each stage
- **Blue structures**: Points indicated
- **Green structures**: Points for sets of scientific symbols
- **Purple structures**: Points based on specific conditions

### Science (Green Structures)

Three symbol types: Tablet, Compass, Gear

- **Identical sets**: Each symbol squared
- **Sets of 3 different**: 7 points per set

## Recommended Strategies

### Basic Strategies

- **Diversify point sources**: Don't focus on just one strategy
- **Watch neighbors**: Their cards affect your options
- **Manage resources**: Build a solid economic base
- **Don't ignore science**: Can provide many points

### Advanced Strategies

- **Defensive drafting**: Take cards others need
- **Specialization**: Focus on science or military based on opportunities
- **Wonder timing**: Build stages at the right moment
- **Table reading**: Anticipate which cards will come to you

## Variants and Expansions

## Tips for Beginners

1. **Learn the cards**: Familiarize yourself with types and costs
2. **Plan the chain**: Many cards have prerequisites
3. **Don't undervalue coins**: They're pure flexibility
4. **Watch science**: Can be very profitable if no one else does it
5. **Balance military**: Don't want to lose all conflicts
