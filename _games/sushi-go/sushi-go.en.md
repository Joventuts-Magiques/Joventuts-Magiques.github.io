## General Description

Sushi Go! is a quick and adorable card game created by Phil Walker-Harding, published by Gamewright in 2013. Each round, players choose cards from their hand and pass them to other players, trying to create the best sushi combinations to score the most points. With its charming illustrations and card drafting mechanic, it's perfect for all ages!

## Game Components

- **108 cards** distributed as follows:
  - 14 tempura
  - 14 sashimi
  - 14 dumplings
  - 12 maki rolls (2 rolls)
  - 8 maki rolls (3 rolls)
  - 6 maki rolls (1 roll)
  - 10 salmon nigiri
  - 5 squid nigiri
  - 5 egg nigiri
  - 10 pudding
  - 6 wasabi
  - 4 chopsticks

## Game Objective

Score the most points over **three rounds** by combining different types of sushi. Each card type scores differently!

## Setup

1. **Shuffle all the cards** in the deck
2. **Deal cards** according to the number of players:
   - For 2 players: 10 cards each
   - For 3 players: 9 cards each
   - For 4 players: 8 cards each
   - For 5 players: 7 cards each
3. Keep the cards in your hand so your opponents can't see them
4. Place the remaining cards face down in a pile in the center of the table
5. Use paper and pencil to keep score

## How to Play

### Round Description

The game is played over **three rounds**. To start a round:

1. **Choose one card** from your hand (one you'd like to keep)
2. **Place it face down** in front of you, simultaneously with all other players
3. **Reveal the chosen cards** at the same time
4. **Pass the remaining cards** in your hand, face down, to the player on your left
5. Repeat until all cards in hand have been played

**Note**: Revealed cards remain in front of you until the end of the round. You want to group cards of the same type!

### Using Wasabi

If you choose a nigiri card (squid, salmon, or egg) and you already have a wasabi card in front of you, you must place the nigiri on top of the wasabi. This indicates you've dipped it in the sauce... **and it triples its value!**

**Note**: You can have multiple wasabi cards in front of you, but you can only place one nigiri card on each wasabi.

### Using Chopsticks

If you already have a chopsticks card in front of you, on a later turn you may choose **two cards** from your hand to play.

To do this:

1. Choose the first card normally from your hand
2. Before other players reveal their cards, say **"Sushi Go!"**
3. Take a second card from your hand and place it face down as well
4. All players reveal their cards
5. Before passing hands, return the chopsticks card to your hand

**Note**: You can have multiple chopsticks cards, but you can only use one per turn.

### End of a Round

When the last card of each hand is passed, simply place it face up with the other cards you've collected. Now calculate points!

## Scoring

### Maki Rolls

Each player adds up the maki roll symbols on their cards:

- The player with the **most rolls** wins **6 points**
- The **second** player with the most rolls wins **3 points**
- If there's a tie for first place, split the 6 points (ignore any remainder) and no points are awarded for second place
- If there's a tie for second place, split the 3 points

### Tempura

- A **pair** (2 cards) of tempura awards **5 points**
- A single tempura card scores nothing
- You can score multiple pairs in the same round

### Sashimi

- A **set of three** (3 cards) sashimi awards **10 points**
- One or two sashimi cards score nothing
- You can score multiple sets in the same round

### Dumplings

The more dumpling cards you have, the more points you score:

- 1 dumpling: **1 point**
- 2 dumplings: **3 points**
- 3 dumplings: **6 points**
- 4 dumplings: **10 points**
- 5 or more dumplings: **15 points**

### Nigiri and Wasabi

- **Squid** nigiri: 3 points (9 with wasabi)
- **Salmon** nigiri: 2 points (6 with wasabi)
- **Egg** nigiri: 1 point (3 with wasabi)
- A wasabi card without nigiri scores nothing

### Chopsticks

A chopsticks card scores nothing.

### Pudding

Pudding cards are **NOT scored** at the end of each round. Keep them in front of you until the end of the game!

## End of Game

After the third round, calculate pudding points:

- The player with the **most pudding cards** wins **6 points**
- The player with the **fewest pudding cards** (including those with none) **loses 6 points**
- If there are ties, split the points (or losses) equally

**Note**: In a two-player game, no points are lost for having fewer puddings. Only 6 points are awarded to whoever has the most.

## And the Winner is

The player who has accumulated the **most points** after three rounds. If there's a tie, the player with the most pudding cards wins.

## Popular Variants

### Passing Cards Both Ways

To change the interaction between players, alternate the direction you pass cards:

- Rounds 1 and 3: pass to the left
- Round 2: pass to the right

### Two-Player Variant

In this variant, a third dummy player is created:

1. Deal cards as if there were three players (3 hands of 9 cards)
2. Place the dummy player's cards between you, in a face-down pile
3. Randomly determine which player will control the dummy first
4. If you control the dummy, draw the top card from their pile and add it to your hand
5. Choose one card for yourself and one for the dummy
6. Alternate turns controlling the dummy player

## Recommended Strategies

### Basic Strategies

- **Watch what others pass**: The cards passed to you give clues about what they're collecting
- **Balance risk and reward**: Sashimi gives lots of points, but it's hard to complete the set
- **Don't forget the maki rolls**: They're "easy" points if no one else collects them
- **Watch the puddings**: They're important at the end of the game!

### Advanced Strategies

- **Block your opponents**: If you see someone needs a specific card, take it yourself
- **Wasabi is powerful**: Combining wasabi with squid nigiri gives 9 points!
- **Count the cards**: Know how many cards of each type are left in the game
- **Adapt**: If everyone is going for maki rolls, maybe go for sashimi instead

## Tips for Beginners

1. **Start with dumplings**: They're easy to collect and give good points
2. **Don't try to do everything**: Focus on 2-3 card types per round
3. **Sashimi is risky**: Don't start collecting it unless you have good odds of completing it
4. **Keep at least one pudding**: Losing 6 points at the end can cost you the game
