## Overview

Ticket to Ride is a railway route building game created by Alan R. Moon in 2004. Players collect train cards to claim railway routes connecting cities across North America. The goal is to complete destination routes while building the longest continuous railway network.

- **110 train cards** (12 of each color + 14 locomotives)
- **30 destination cards**
- **5 wooden scoring markers**
- **1 scoring track**
- **Rules summary**

## Game Objective

Accumulate the maximum number of points by completing destination routes, building railway routes, and obtaining the longest continuous route.

## Setup

1. **Place the board** in the center of the table
2. **Each player chooses a color** and takes 45 train cars and corresponding marker
3. **Place markers** on 0 of the scoring track
4. **Shuffle train cards** and deal 4 to each player
5. **Place 5 train cards** face-up beside the board
6. **Shuffle destination cards** and deal 3 to each player
7. **Each player keeps at least 2** destination cards (may discard 1)

## How to Play

On your turn, you must do **one** of the following actions:

### 1. Draw Train Cards

- **Draw 2 cards** from the 5 face-up or from the deck
- If you draw a **face-up locomotive**, you can only draw 1 card
- Immediately refill face-up cards

### 2. Claim a Route

- **Play cards of the same color** equal to the route length
- **Locomotives** can substitute any color
- **Place your train cars** on the route
- **Score points** according to route length
- **Gray routes** can be claimed with any single color

### 3. Draw Destination Cards

- **Draw 3 destination cards** from the deck
- **Keep at least 1** (may discard up to 2)

- **2 cars**: 2 points
- **3 cars**: 4 points
- **4 cars**: 7 points
- **5 cars**: 10 points
- **6 cars**: 15 points

## Game End

The game ends when a player has **2 or fewer train cars** at the end of their turn. Each player gets one more turn.

## Final Scoring

1. **Route points**: Already scored during the game
2. **Destination cards**:
   - **Completed**: Add the indicated points
   - **Incomplete**: Subtract the indicated points
3. **Longest continuous route**: 10 bonus points (in case of tie, all tied players receive points)

## Recommended Strategies

### Basic Strategies

- **Prioritize destinations**: They're the biggest source of points
- **Build long routes**: They give more points per car
- **Block opponents**: Take routes others need
- **Manage cards**: Don't hoard too many unused cards

### Advanced Strategies

- **Diversify destinations**: Don't depend on a single critical route
- **Control bottlenecks**: 1-2 car routes are crucial
- **Destination timing**: Draw new cards when you have secure routes
- **Watch opponents**: Deduce their destinations from their moves

### Risk Management

- **Don't take impossible destinations**: Better to discard than lose points
- **Build critical routes first**: Those with only one option
- **Maintain flexibility**: Locomotives are valuable for emergencies

## Game Variants

### Double Routes

- Only in 4-5 player games
- Each player can claim one of two parallel routes
- In 2-3 player games, only one double route can be used

### Stations (Optional Variant)

Some maps include stations that allow using other players' routes.

## Tips for Beginners

1. **Start with short destinations**: They're easier to complete
2. **Don't hoard too many cards**: Build regularly
3. **Study the board**: Identify the most contested routes
4. **Use locomotives wisely**: They're very versatile
5. **Don't forget longest route**: 10 points can decide the game
