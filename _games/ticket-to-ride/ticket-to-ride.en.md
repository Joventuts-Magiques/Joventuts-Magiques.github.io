## Overview

Ticket to Ride is a railway route building game created by Alan R. Moon in 2004. Players collect train cards to claim railway routes connecting cities across North America. The goal is to complete destination routes while building the longest continuous railway network.

## Game Components

- **Game board** with North America map
- **240 colored train cars** (48 per player in 5 colors)
- **110 train cards** (12 of each color + 14 locomotives)
- **30 destination cards**
- **5 wooden scoring markers**
- **1 scoring track**
- **Rules summary**

## Game Objective

Accumulate the maximum number of points by completing destination routes, building railway routes, and obtaining the longest continuous route.

## Setup

1. **Place the board** in the center of the table
2. **Each player chooses a color** and takes 45 train cars and corresponding marker
3. **Place markers** on 0 of the scoring track
4. **Shuffle train cards** and deal 4 to each player
5. **Place 5 train cards** face-up beside the board
6. **Shuffle destination cards** and deal 3 to each player
7. **Each player keeps at least 2** destination cards (may discard 1)

## How to Play

On your turn, you must do **one** of the following actions:

### 1. Draw Train Cards

- **Draw 2 cards** from the 5 face-up or from the deck
- If you draw a **face-up locomotive**, you can only draw 1 card
- Immediately refill face-up cards

### 2. Claim a Route

- **Play cards of the same color** equal to the route length
- **Locomotives** can substitute any color
- **Place your train cars** on the route
- **Score points** according to route length
- **Gray routes** can be claimed with any single color

### 3. Draw Destination Cards

- **Draw 3 destination cards** from the deck
- **Keep at least 1** (may discard up to 2)

## Route Scoring

- **1 car**: 1 point
- **2 cars**: 2 points
- **3 cars**: 4 points
- **4 cars**: 7 points
- **5 cars**: 10 points
- **6 cars**: 15 points

## Game End

The game ends when a player has **2 or fewer train cars** at the end of their turn. Each player gets one more turn.

## Final Scoring

1. **Route points**: Already scored during the game
2. **Destination cards**:
   - **Completed**: Add the indicated points
   - **Incomplete**: Subtract the indicated points
3. **Longest continuous route**: 10 bonus points (in case of tie, all tied players receive points)

## Recommended Strategies

### Basic Strategies

- **Prioritize destinations**: They're the biggest source of points
- **Build long routes**: They give more points per car
- **Block opponents**: Take routes others need
- **Manage cards**: Don't hoard too many unused cards

### Advanced Strategies

- **Diversify destinations**: Don't depend on a single critical route
- **Control bottlenecks**: 1-2 car routes are crucial
- **Destination timing**: Draw new cards when you have secure routes
- **Watch opponents**: Deduce their destinations from their moves

### Risk Management

- **Don't take impossible destinations**: Better to discard than lose points
- **Build critical routes first**: Those with only one option
- **Maintain flexibility**: Locomotives are valuable for emergencies

## Game Variants

### Double Routes

- Only in 4-5 player games
- Each player can claim one of two parallel routes
- In 2-3 player games, only one double route can be used

### Stations (Optional Variant)

Some maps include stations that allow using other players' routes.

## Ticket to Ride: Europe - Specific Rules

The European version adds three new mechanics that make the game more strategic and complex:

### Stations (3 per player)

Stations allow you to use another player's route to complete your destinations.

**How they work:**

- Each player starts with **3 stations**
- To build a station, **discard train cards**:
  - First station: 1 card of any color
  - Second station: 2 cards of the same color
  - Third station: 3 cards of the same color
- Place the station on **any city** on the board
- You can use **one route** connecting to this city, even if it belongs to another player
- You can only use **one route per station**

**Scoring:**

- Each **unused station** at the end: **4 bonus points**
- Used stations: 0 points

**Strategy:**

- Use stations as **plan B** if you get blocked
- Try **not to use them** to gain the 4 bonus points
- Build stations **before you get blocked**

### Tunnels

Tunnels add uncertainty to the cost of building routes.

**Identification:**

- Routes marked with **mountain symbols** on the board

**How they work:**

1. Play the cards needed for the tunnel length
2. **Flip the top 3 cards** from the train deck
3. For each card that **matches the color** you played (or locomotive):
   - You must **play 1 additional card** of the same color
4. If you can't or don't want to pay the extra cost:
   - **Take back all cards** played
   - **Lose your turn**

**Example:**

- You want to build a 3-car blue tunnel
- You play 3 blue cards
- You flip 3 cards: 1 blue, 1 red, 1 locomotive
- You must play **2 more blue cards** (1 for blue, 1 for locomotive)
- If you don't have 2 blue cards, take back the 3 initial cards and lose your turn

**Strategy:**

- Tunnels are **riskier** than normal routes
- Have **extra cards** before building a tunnel
- **Locomotives** are especially useful for tunnels
- Build tunnels **when you have card margin**

### Ferries

Ferries require locomotives to be built.

**Identification:**

- Routes with **ship symbols** on the board
- Some route spaces have **locomotive symbols**

**How they work:**

- For each **locomotive symbol** on the route:
  - You must **play a locomotive** (mandatory)
- The remaining spaces can be filled with cards of the corresponding color

**Example:**

- A 4-car gray ferry with 2 locomotive symbols:
  - You must play **2 locomotives**
  - Plus **2 cards of the same color** (any color since it's gray)

**Strategy:**

- **Save locomotives** for ferries
- Ferries are **more expensive** than normal routes
- Plan ahead which ferries you need
- Compete for **face-up locomotives** when you see them

### Long Distance Destination Cards

Europe includes **long distance** destination cards with higher scores.

**Initial setup:**

- Each player receives **1 long destination card** (mandatory)
- Plus **3 normal destination cards** (keep at least 2)

**Characteristics:**

- Worth **more points** (up to 21 points)
- Connect **very distant** cities
- More **difficult to complete**
- But offer **great reward**

**Strategy:**

- The long card **sets your initial strategy**
- Build the **backbone** of the long route first
- Then add **secondary destinations** that align
- Don't take more long cards if you don't have a clear route

### Component Differences

**Europe includes:**

- **Europe board** with 46 cities
- **15 stations** (3 per player in 5 colors)
- **Tunnels** marked on the board
- **Ferries** marked on the board
- **Long destination cards** separated
- **More destination cards** total (46 vs 30)

### Specific Tips for Europe

1. **Manage stations**: They're your insurance against blocking
2. **Plan tunnels**: Always have extra cards
3. **Accumulate locomotives**: Needed for ferries and useful for tunnels
4. **Alternative routes**: Europe has more path options
5. **Long destinations**: Can win or lose the game
6. **Strategic blocking**: Bottlenecks are more critical
7. **Station timing**: Build them before it's too late

### Comparison: America vs Europe

**America (Original):**

- More **simple** and **straightforward**
- Better for **beginners**
- Less **randomness**
- **Faster** games

**Europe:**

- More **strategic** and **complex**
- Better for **experienced players**
- More **interaction** and **decisions**
- **Longer** and more **tactical** games
- **Stations** reduce blocking frustration
- **Tunnels and ferries** add uncertainty and planning

## Tips for Beginners

1. **Start with short destinations**: They're easier to complete
2. **Don't hoard too many cards**: Build regularly
3. **Study the board**: Identify the most contested routes
4. **Use locomotives wisely**: They're very versatile
5. **Don't forget longest route**: 10 points can decide the game
