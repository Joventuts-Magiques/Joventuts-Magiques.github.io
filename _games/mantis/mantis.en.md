## General Description

MANTIS is a quick and colorful card game created by Ken Gruhl and Jeremy Posner, published by Exploding Kittens in 2022. Each turn you must make a crucial decision: try to score for yourself or risk stealing cards from your rivals. The card color system gives you hints about what might come up, but you'll never know for sure until you flip the card!

## Game Components

- **105 cards** (7 different colors, 15 cards of each color)

Each card has two sides:

- **Front (white face)**: Shows a single-color character
- **Back (black face)**: Shows three different colors

**Important**: The color of the character on the front is always one of the three colors shown on the back of that same card.

## Game Objective

Be the first player to accumulate **10 or more cards** in your scoring pile. The color of the cards is irrelevant for winning.

## Setup

1. **Shuffle all the cards** in the deck
2. **Deal 4 cards face up** (white face) to each player. This collection of cards is their **Tank**
3. If you have multiple cards of the same color in your Tank, stack them slightly fanned out so you can see how many there are
4. **Place the rest of the deck face down** (black face) in the center of the table. This is the **Draw Pile**
5. Leave space in front of each player for their **Scoring Pile**
6. Choose a player to start. Play continues clockwise

## How to Play

### Your Turn

When it's your turn, **DON'T TOUCH** the top card of the draw pile until you've decided what action you'll take:

### Option 1: Try to Score

1. Take the top card from the draw pile
2. Flip it into **your Tank**
3. **If the color matches** any character already in your Tank:
   - Move **all** cards of that color (including the new one) to your **Scoring Pile**
4. **If it doesn't match**:
   - Leave the card in your Tank
5. Your turn ends

**Note**: Trying to score is the **only way** to move cards to your scoring pile!

### Option 2: Try to Steal

1. Take the top card from the draw pile
2. Flip it into **another player's Tank**
3. **If the color matches** any character in their Tank:
   - Move **all** cards of that color (including the new one) to **your Tank**
4. **If it doesn't match**:
   - Leave the card in that player's Tank
5. Your turn ends

**Important**: Stolen cards go to your **Tank**, NOT to your scoring pile!

### Strategic Tip

Since you know the front color will be one of the three colors on the back, you can look at the black face of the top card before deciding whether to score or steal (and from whom).

## End of Game

### Victory Condition

The first player to accumulate **10 or more cards** in their scoring pile **wins immediately**.

### If Cards Run Out

- If you have no cards in your Tank, simply keep playing and try to get some on your next turn
- If the draw pile runs out, the player with the most cards in their scoring pile wins
- In case of a tie, the player with the most cards in their Tank wins

### Scoring Pile

- Cards in the scoring pile must be **face down** (black face)
- You must tell the **number of cards** (but not the colors) if any player asks

## Popular Variants

### 2-Player Games

- The goal changes to accumulating **15 cards** instead of 10
- If you steal successfully, **you play another turn**
- You can chain turns as long as you keep stealing successfully

## Recommended Strategies

### Basic Strategies

- **Watch rival Tanks**: See what colors they have accumulated to decide if stealing is worth it
- **Calculate the odds**: The back shows 3 possible colors, you have a 33% chance for each
- **Balance risk and reward**: Stealing can give you many cards, but if you fail you gift them to your rival

### Advanced Strategies

- **Score when you have few colors**: Fewer colors in your Tank = higher chance of matching
- **Steal when rivals have many cards of one color**: The potential reward is greater
- **Watch the scoring piles**: Know who's close to winning to decide whether to take risks

## Tips for Beginners

1. **Understand the difference between Tank and Scoring Pile**: Only cards in the scoring pile count toward winning
2. **Don't forget that stealing doesn't score directly**: Stolen cards go to your Tank, then you'll need to score them
3. **Always look at the back before deciding**: It gives you valuable information about possible colors
4. **Start by trying to score**: It's safer while you learn the game
