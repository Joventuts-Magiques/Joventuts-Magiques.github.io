## General Description

Pelusas is a quick and simple push-your-luck card game. Players collect cards from a central pile representing dust bunnies, trying to accumulate the most points without repeating numbers. The twist is that your cards stay visible and other players can steal them!

## Game Components

- **110 cards** numbered from 1 to 10:
  - Numbers 1-5: **13 cards** each
  - Numbers 6-10: **9 cards** each

## Game Objective

Accumulate the most victory points by the time the central pile runs out.

## Setup

1. **Shuffle all cards** and place them face-down in a messy pile in the center of the table - these are the "dust bunnies"
2. The player with the most dust bunnies under their bed goes first (or the youngest)

## How to Play

### Your Turn

#### Step 1: Collect saved cards

- If you have cards saved from the previous turn (face-down), flip them and add them to your **scoring pile** - they're now safe points!

#### Step 2: Draw cards

- Draw cards **one at a time** from the central pile
- Place each card **face-up** in front of you, organized by number
- The **first two cards** are always safe

#### Step 3: Decide - Continue or Stop?

After each card (starting from the third), decide:

#### If you continue drawing

- If the card **DOESN'T repeat** any number you already have → add it to your visible cards
- If the card **DOES repeat** a number → you **LOSE ALL** cards from this turn! (they go to discard)

#### If you stop

- Flip your cards in front of you **face-down**
- These cards stay saved until your next turn
- At the start of your next turn, you'll add them to your scoring pile

### Stealing Cards from Rivals

This is where the game gets interesting!

When you reveal a card, look at other players' **visible** cards:

- If your number **matches** visible cards from a rival, you **steal ALL** their cards of that number
- Stolen cards are added to your visible cards (of the same number)
- Watch out! Now you have more visible cards that can be stolen from you!

**Example**: You reveal a 4. Maria has two visible 4s. You steal both 4s and now have three 4s in front of you.

## End of Game

The game ends when the central pile runs out of cards.

### Scoring

- Each card in your **scoring pile** is worth **1 point** (the number doesn't matter, only the quantity)
- The player with the most points wins!

### Tiebreaker

In case of a tie, the player with the highest numbered card in their scoring pile wins.

## Recommended Strategies

### Basic Strategies

- **Stop before having too many different numbers**: The more numbers you have, the higher the chance of repeating
- **High numbers are safer**: There are fewer cards of 6-10 (only 9 of each)
- **Take advantage of stealing**: If you see a rival with many cards of one number, try to draw it!

### Advanced Strategies

- **Count the cards**: If you remember which numbers have come out, you can better calculate the risk
- **Provoke rivals**: Accumulate few visible cards to avoid being an attractive target
- **Timing your stops**: Sometimes it's worth stopping with 3-4 cards to secure points
- **End game**: When few cards remain, take more risks!

## Tips for Beginners

1. **The first two are free**: You can always draw two cards without danger
2. **Don't be too greedy**: 4-5 cards is often a good amount to save
3. **Watch the others**: Rivals' visible cards give you information about what's left
4. **Stealing changes everything**: A stolen card can be the difference between winning and losing

## Why It's Fun

- **Fast**: 20-minute games
- **Easy to learn**: Very simple rules
- **Constant tension**: Every card could be good or bad
- **Interactive**: Stealing creates very fun moments
- **For everyone**: Perfect for families and diverse groups
