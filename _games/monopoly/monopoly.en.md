Monopoly is a classic real estate trading game created in 1935. Players move around the board buying properties, building houses and hotels, and collecting rent from other players. The goal is to accumulate wealth while driving opponents into bankruptcy.

## Game Components

- **Game board** with 40 different spaces
- **2 six-sided dice**
- **Player tokens** (8 different types: dog, cat, ship, shoe, hat, car, horse, cannon)

## Game Objective

## Setup

1. **Place the board** in the center of the table
2. **Each player chooses a token** and places it on "GO"

4. **The Banker distributes $1,500** to each player:
   - 2 × $500 bills
   - 2 × $100 bills
   - 2 × $50 bills
   - 6 × $20 bills
   - 5 × $10 bills
   - 5 × $5 bills

5. **Shuffle the Chance and Community Chest cards** and place them on their spaces
6. **Determine play order** by rolling dice (highest goes first)

## How to Play

### On Your Turn

1. **Roll both dice** and move your token clockwise
2. **Follow the instructions** of the space you land on
3. **If you roll doubles**, take another turn (maximum 3 consecutive doubles)

### Types of Spaces

#### Properties

- **Regular properties**: You can buy them if unowned

- **Jail**: You can be "Just Visiting" or "In Jail"
- **Free Parking**: Nothing happens (official rule)
- **Go to Jail**: Move directly to jail
- **Taxes**: Pay the indicated amount

### Buying Properties

When you land on an unowned property:

- You can **buy it** for the price shown on the board
- If you **don't buy it**, it goes to public auction
- You receive the **property deed** when you purchase it

### Building Houses and Hotels

- You must **own all properties in a color group** (monopoly)
- Houses must be built **evenly** (maximum difference of 1 house)
- **4 houses = 1 hotel** (you must return houses to the bank)
- Building costs are shown on the property deed

### Paying Rent

When you land on another player's property:

- **Pay the rent** shown on the deed
- Rent **increases** with houses and hotels
- If the owner has the **complete color group**, rent doubles (without buildings)

### Getting Out of Jail

You can get out of jail by:

1. **Paying $50** before rolling the dice
2. **Rolling doubles** on any of your 3 turns
3. **Using a "Get Out of Jail Free" card**
4. **Automatically** after your 3rd turn (paying $50)

### Trading

- You can **negotiate** with other players at any time
- You can trade: properties, money, "Get Out of Jail Free" cards
- **No loans** or future payments allowed

### Bankruptcy

A player goes bankrupt when they:

- Cannot pay a debt

## Recommended Strategies

### Advanced Strategies

- **Control the railroads** for consistent income

- **Calculate probabilities** of landing on different properties

### Property Groups by Priority

1. **Orange** (most likely to be landed on)
2. **Red** (high probability after leaving jail)

4. **Green** (expensive but very profitable)
