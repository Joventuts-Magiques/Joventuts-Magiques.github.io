## Overview

Magic: The Gathering (MTG) is a collectible card game created by Richard Garfield in 1993. Players take on the role of "planeswalkers" who cast spells, summon creatures, and use artifacts to defeat their opponents.

## Basic Components

### Card Types

- **Lands**: Generate mana, the resource needed to play other cards
- **Creatures**: Attack and defend
- **Spells**: Instant or permanent effects
- **Artifacts**: Magical objects with special abilities
- **Planeswalkers**: Powerful allies with unique abilities

### Mana Colors

- **White** ⚪: Order, protection, healing
- **Blue** 🔵: Control, card draw, counterspells
- **Black** ⚫: Power at any cost, destruction, reanimation
- **Red** 🔴: Chaos, direct damage, speed
- **Green** 🟢: Nature, large creatures, growth

## Objective

Reduce your opponent's life points from 20 to 0, or win through alternative conditions specified on some cards.

## Setup

1. Each player needs a **deck** of at least 60 cards
2. Shuffle your deck
3. Each player starts with **20 life points**
4. Draw 7 starting cards
5. Decide who goes first (coin flip or die roll)

### Mulligan

If you don't like your starting hand, you can "mulligan": shuffle your hand back into the deck, draw one fewer card, and repeat if necessary.

## How to Play

### Turn Structure

1. **Beginning Phase**
   - Untap your tapped cards
   - Draw a card

2. **Main Phase (First)**
   - Play a land (maximum one per turn)
   - Cast spells, creatures, artifacts
   - Activate abilities

3. **Combat Phase**
   - Declare attackers
   - Opponent declares blockers
   - Damage is resolved

4. **Main Phase (Second)**
   - Same as first main phase

5. **End Phase**
   - Discard down to 7 cards if you have more

### Combat

- **Attacking**: Tap the creatures you want to attack with
- **Blocking**: Opponent can block with their creatures without tapping
- **Damage**: Blocked and blocking creatures deal damage to each other
- **Unblocked damage**: Goes directly to opponent's life points

## Strategy

### Deck Building

- **Mana curve**: Balance the cost of your cards
- **Synergy**: Choose cards that work well together
- **Removal**: Include cards to eliminate threats
- **Card draw**: Keep your hand full of options

### During the Game
