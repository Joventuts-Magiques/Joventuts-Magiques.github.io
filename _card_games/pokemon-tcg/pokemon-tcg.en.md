## Game Objective

Win in three possible ways:

1. **Claim all 6 Prize cards** by defeating rival Pokémon
2. **Defeat all opponent's Pokémon** (they have no Active Pokémon)
3. **Opponent cannot draw** a card at the start of their turn

## Setup

1. **Each player needs a deck** of exactly 60 cards
2. **Shuffle your deck** and place it face-down
3. **Draw 7 cards** for your starting hand
4. **Place 6 Prize cards** face-down (without looking at them)
5. **Find a Basic Pokémon** in your hand:
   - Place it as your **Active Pokémon** (face-up)
   - You may place up to 5 **Pokémon on the Bench** (face-up)
6. If you don't have any Basic Pokémon:
   - Show your hand
   - Shuffle and draw 7 new cards
   - Opponent may draw 1 extra card

## Turn Structure

### 1. Beginning Phase

- **Draw 1 card** from your deck
- **Check Special Conditions** (Poisoned, Burned, etc.)

### 2. Main Phase

You can do as many actions as you want in any order:

- **Play Basic Pokémon** to the Bench
- **Evolve Pokémon** (not on first turn or same turn it was played)
- **Attach Energy** (one per turn, to any Pokémon)
- **Play Trainer cards**
- **Retreat your Active Pokémon** (pay retreat cost)
- **Use Abilities** from your Pokémon

### 3. Attack Phase

- **Choose an attack** from your Active Pokémon
- **Check you have the required energy**
- **Apply the attack's effect**
- **Calculate damage**:
  - Base damage from the attack
  - ×2 if **super effective** (weakness)
  - ÷2 if **not very effective** (resistance, round up)
  - Apply special effects

### 4. End of Turn

- Turn passes to opponent
- Discard down to 10 cards if you have more

## Combat Mechanics

### Weakness and Resistance

- **Weakness**: Damage is multiplied (usually ×2)
- **Resistance**: Damage is reduced (usually -20 or -30)

### Special Conditions

- **Poisoned** ☠️: Takes 10 damage between turns
- **Burned** 🔥: Takes 20 damage between turns, flip coin to heal
- **Paralyzed** ⚡: Cannot attack or retreat next turn
- **Asleep** 💤: Flip coin to wake up, cannot attack or retreat
- **Confused** 😵: Flip coin to attack, if fails takes 30 damage

### Knocking Out a Pokémon

When a Pokémon takes damage equal to or greater than its HP:

1. **It's Knocked Out** and goes to the discard pile
2. Opponent **claims 1 Prize card** (2 for EX/GX, 3 for VMAX)
3. **Promote a Pokémon** from Bench to Active
