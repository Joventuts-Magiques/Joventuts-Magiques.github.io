## What is Commander?

Commander is **Magic: The Gathering's** most popular format for casual and social play. Magic is the world's most popular collectible card game, created in 1993, where players take on the role of "planeswalkers" who cast spells and summon creatures to defeat their opponents.

Commander features long, strategic multiplayer games with high player interaction, using 100-card unique decks led by a legendary commander.

## Basic Rules

### Deck Construction

- **Exactly 100 cards**: Including the commander
- **Singleton**: Only one copy of each card (except basic lands)
- **Color identity**: You can only use cards that match your commander's colors
- **The Commander**: A legendary creature or planeswalker that defines your deck's color identity

### Game Setup

- **Starting life points**: 40 (double the standard formats)
- **Command zone**: Your commander starts here, outside your deck
- **Number of players**: Generally 3-4 players, but can vary

### Special Rules

- **Casting the commander**: You can cast your commander from the command zone
- **Commander tax**: Each time you recast your commander, it costs {2} additional for each previous time
- **Commander damage**: If a commander deals 21 or more combat damage to a player, that player loses the game
- **Command zone**: When your commander would die or be exiled, you may return it to the command zone

## How to Play

### Game Setup

1. **Choose your commander**: Select a legendary creature or planeswalker
2. **Build your deck**: 99 cards + the commander (100 total)
3. **Shuffle your deck**: The commander starts in the command zone, not in the deck
4. **Life points**: Each player starts with 40 life points
5. **Starting hand**: Draw 7 cards (you can mulligan if needed)
6. **Determine order**: Decide who goes first (die roll or coin flip)

### Turn Structure

Each turn follows Magic's standard phases:

1. **Beginning Phase**
   - Untap your tapped cards
   - Draw a card (except on the first turn of the starting player)

2. **Main Phase (First)**
   - Play a land (maximum one per turn)
   - Cast your commander or other spells
   - Activate abilities of your permanents

3. **Combat Phase**
   - **Declare attackers**: Choose which creatures attack and whom
   - **Declare blockers**: Opponents can block with their creatures
   - **Combat damage**: Creatures deal damage to each other

4. **Main Phase (Second)**
   - Same as the first main phase
   - Play more spells or activate abilities

5. **End Phase**
   - Discard down to 7 cards if you have more
   - "Until end of turn" effects end

### Key Mechanics

- **The Commander**: You can cast it from the command zone whenever you could normally play that card
- **Tax**: Each time you recast the commander, it costs {2} more for each previous time you've cast it
- **Commander Damage**: Track combat damage each commander deals to each player - 21 points is lethal
- **Color Identity**: You can only use cards with mana symbols that match your commander's colors

### Win Conditions

You win the game when:
- You're the last player remaining with life points
- All other players have been eliminated
- You achieve an alternative win condition from a card

A player loses when:
- Their life points reach 0 or less
- They've taken 21 or more combat damage from a single commander
- They can't draw a card when required to
- A card says they lose the game

## Format Strategy

### Deck Building

- **Commander synergy**: Choose cards that enhance your commander's abilities
- **Mana curve**: Include cards of different costs to stay active each turn
- **Ramp**: Add cards that accelerate your mana production
- **Card draw**: Essential for maintaining resources in long games
- **Removal**: Include answers for varied threats
- **Wipes**: Effects that clear the battlefield when you fall behind

### During the Game

- **Politics**: Commander is a social game - alliances and negotiations are key
- **Threat management**: Don't become the most dangerous player too early
- **Commander protection**: Protect your commander from removal to avoid paying the tax
- **Timing**: Watch when other players spend their resources
- **Patience**: Games are long - don't rush
